# About
This project is an EDA on the Top 100 Kdramas (By Rating) on MyDramaList :information_source:
<br>
The project aims to pull some useful insights from the data provided in the CSV file.


# Backstory
After completing just about ~~a hundred~~ pandas courses online, I think it was about time I started my **first** EDA project.
<br>
<br>
I thought long and hard about what I wanted my project to be about, and since I **love**  *Korean Dramas*, why not make my very first project an EDA on Kdramas!


# Issues
Please feel free to raise an issue if an error is discovered in the notebook :heavy_exclamation_mark:
<br>
I would also love to hear some feedback on my code as I am trying to find ways to improve myself :smile:
